      <h2>Newlines Converter</h2>
      <p>This tool converts lines of text to JSON or a SQL VALUES list and copies them to the clipboard.</p>
      <h3>Use-case scenarios</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A customer success manager sends you a long list of IDs and wants you to query some information about them from the database.
          You need to paste them into SQL in the format (ID1, ID2, ID3, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          You are debugging an issue in your SAAS application and you want to load some IDs from a spreadsheet into the browser console as
          an array so you can compare them with network responses. Therefore you need to convert the list into JSON so it can be pasted into the console without writing out parsing logic.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Get started</h3>
      <p>Paste your list into the input below or <button data-role="enable-clipboard-permissions">enable clipboard permissions</button>to have the extension automatically read the list from your clipboard.</p>
